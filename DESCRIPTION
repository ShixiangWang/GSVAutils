Description: Immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint
    inhibitors (ICI), is transforming the treatment of cancer. However,
    only a small percentage of patients show response to ICI, and there is
    an unmet need for biomarkers that will identify patients who are more
    likely to respond to immunotherapy. The fundamental basis for ICI
    response is the immunogenicity of a tumor, which is primarily
    determined by tumor antigenicity and antigen presentation efficiency.
    Here, we propose a method to measure tumor immunogenicity score
    (TIGS), which combines tumor mutational burden (TMB) and an expression
    signature of the antigen processing and presenting machinery (APM).
    In both correlation with pan-cancer ICI objective response rates (ORR)
    and ICI clinical response prediction for individual patients, TIGS
    consistently showed improved performance compared to TMB and other
    known prediction biomarkers for ICI response. This study suggests that
    TIGS is an effective tumor-inherent biomarker for ICI-response
    prediction.
